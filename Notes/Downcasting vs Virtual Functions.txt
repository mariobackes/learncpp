Downcasting vs virtual functions

There are some developers who believe dynamic_cast is evil and indicative of a bad class design. Instead, these programmers say you should use virtual functions.

In general, using a virtual function should be preferred over downcasting. However, there are times when downcasting is the better choice:

When you can not modify the base class to add a virtual function
When you need access to something that is derived-class specific
When adding a virtual function to your base class doesn’t make sense (e.g. there is no appropriate value for the base class to return)
