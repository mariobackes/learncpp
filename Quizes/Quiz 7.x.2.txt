a)
	The function returns a reference to an element that will be destroyed after the function terminates.
	
b)
	This recursive function has no termination condition and therefore will run endlessly.
	
c)
	These overloaded functions differ only by return type. That is not allowed in C++.
	
d)
	The declaration of an array of that size will cause the stack to overflow and therefore crash the program.
	A ood alternative wuld be to allocate the array dynamically.
	
e)
	argv[1] is a c-style string and this program tries to evaluate it as an integer. This will not work.
	Also argv[1] may not exist.
