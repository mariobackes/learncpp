1) Assuming Point is a class and point is an instance of that class, should you use a normal/friend or member function overload for the following operators?

1a) point + point
1b) -point
1c) std::cout << point
1d) point = 5;

My answers:

	a) friend
	b) member
	c) member - because this overload needs a *this pointer it can return so output can be chained
	d) member - assignment operator needs to be a member function
	
The correct answers:

	1a) binary operator+ is best implemented as a normal/friend function.
	1b) unary operator- is best implemented as a member function.
	1c) operator<< must be implemented as a normal/friend function.
	1d) operator= must be implemented as a member function.
