1) Would you be more likely to implement the following as a composition or an aggregation?
1a) A ball that has a color
1b) A employer containing multiple employees
1c) The departments in a university
1d) Your age
1e) A bag of marbles



a)  If you want to store color as a string, then I would implement it as a composition.
	However, if the color should be able to store e.g the RGB values of a color then I would make it an aggregation,
		because a color object should be able to exist independantly of the Ball object.
		
b)  As an aggregation.

c) As a composition.

d) ?????? as an int.

e) As aggregation, the marbles should be able to have properties.

Correct answers:

1a) Composition: Color is an intrinsic property of a ball.
1b) Aggregation: An employer doesn’t start with any employees and hopefully doesn’t destroy all its employees when it goes bankrupt.
1c) Composition: Departments can’t exist in absence of a university.
1d) Composition: Your age is an intrinsic property of you.
1e) Aggregation: The bag and the marbles inside have independent existences.
